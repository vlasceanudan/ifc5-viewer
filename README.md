# IFC 5 development repository

Welcome to the **IFC 5 alpha Examples**!  These examples are the result of years of work by many volunteers. The IFC implementer forum, the IFC 5 taskforce, and the wider community of interested implementers, have been working on these examples inntensively. This repository contains initial examples for the IFC 5 developments.

## Disclaimer: Early Stage Examples

Please note that these examples are **preliminary** and represent a direction of working for IFC 5. There are several **important caveats** to keep in mind:

1. **Incomplete Features**: Many features of IFC 5 have not been fully explored or implemented in these examples. 
2. **Schema Changes**: IFC 5 is still evolving, and future updates to the development will require revisions to these examples.
3. **Limited Validation**: These examples have undergone significant validation and testing. However, they are still incomplete.
4. **Known Issues**: There are known and unknown issues and incomplete sections within the examples.
5. **Development in Progress**: Further work is needed to improve the quality, accuracy, and completeness of these examples.

## Viewer

A viewer to visualize and explore the files is available under /docs/viewer. It is also live on https://ifc5.technical.buildingsmart.org/viewer/
The viewer source code is MIT licensed. The intent is to help users understand the examples; and to help software developers to understand how to implement the composition of the objects.

## Schema

The schema sourece is defined using typespec and can be found under /schema.
The JSON schema of IFC, and extensions will be published on ifcx.dev

## Future Development

Further **documentation will follow soon**. 
We are actively working on enhancing these examples, addressing known issues. Contributions, feedback, and collaboration are welcome! If you would like to contribute or discuss the development of these examples, feel free to open an issue.
 

## Usage

You are welcome to clone or download this repository, but please bear in mind the current limitations and treat these examples as a **work in progress**. 
Do not create derivatives of these examples, but please actively contribute with PRs and opening issues.
